    <p>
    Ever since I was born, I was playing video games and I always had a pasion for them, even up to now. I don't play as much as I used to but when I do play, I get back into my old ways. One game I really enjoy playing is called Rainbow Six Siege and I play competitively. I won a tornament with a group of my friends and to me personally it was one of the best achievements in my life.
